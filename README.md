# Financial literacy for computer science students

I will be using this page to collect notes and slides I'll be preparing for the lecture series of the same name at UT Austin. 

Note that this is not an official course, and you do not get any credit for attending the lectures.

## Meeting Time (Spring 2024)

When: Every Monday, from 4 - 5 PM CST

Where: GDC 5.302

Registration required: no (just show up!)

## Why do this?

Thanks to the tech boom, CS students enjoy the privilege of high compensation when they join tech companies. 
However, until that point, they may not have had any training or experience in dealing with large amounts of money. 
Working at tech companies also involves things like Restricted Stock Units and vesting, which students may not be familiar with.
This lecture series aims to close that gap and provide students with basic knowledge in financial literacy. 

## Is there anything new here?

No. All the information I'm presenting is available freely on the web, in various places.
I am merely collecting this information together and presenting it in one place. 

## Are the meetings recorded?

No. We would like to encourage free Q n A during these meetings/lectures. So they are not recorded.
